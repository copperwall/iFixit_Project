# iFixit Project

This repo is for a project for [iFixit](http://ifixit.com). Everything in here right now is a prototype to help me better understand some of the tools I'll be using.

## Tools

As of now, this project should make use of:

*  The iFixit API
*  jQuery/jQueryUI (For drag and drop capabilities)
*  HTML5 IndexedDB (For local storage)

**NOTICE:** Everything here is subject to change until I get a more in-depth specification. Changes in spec, tool use, and requirements will be reflected here.
